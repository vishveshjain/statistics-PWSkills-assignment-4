    "Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are both ways of describing the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to a certain value. In other words, the PMF gives the probability mass at each possible value of the random variable. The PMF is often denoted as P(X=x), where X is the random variable and x is a possible value that X can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a coin that is flipped three times, where each flip has a probability of 0.5 of resulting in heads. The number of heads that come up can be modeled by a discrete random variable X with possible values 0, 1, 2, or 3. The PMF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X=0) = 0.125\n",
    "P(X=1) = 0.375\n",
    "P(X=2) = 0.375\n",
    "P(X=3) = 0.125\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF indicates that the probability of getting 0 heads is 0.125, the probability of getting 1 head is 0.375, and so on. The sum of all the probabilities is 1, since one of these outcomes must occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Probability Density Function (PDF), on the other hand, is a function that describes the relative likelihood that a continuous random variable takes on a certain value. In other words, the PDF gives the density of probability per unit of the random variable. The area under the curve of the PDF over a certain interval gives the probability of the random variable falling within that interval. The PDF is often denoted as f(X), where X is the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a continuous random variable X that follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The PDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "f(X) = (1 / sqrt(2π)) * exp(-X^2/2)\n",
    "\n",
    "This PDF describes the shape of the normal distribution, which is a bell-shaped curve centered at the mean of 0. The density of probability is highest at the mean and decreases symmetrically as X moves away from the mean in either direction. The area under the curve of the PDF between two values of X gives the probability that X falls within that range. For example, the probability that X falls between -1 and 1 can be calculated by integrating the PDF between -1 and 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(-1 ≤ X ≤ 1) = ∫[-1,1] f(X) dX = 0.6827\n",

    "The Cumulative Density Function (CDF) is a function that describes the probability that a random variable X is less than or equal to a certain value x. In other words, the CDF of X gives the cumulative probability of X taking on a value less than or equal to x. The CDF is often denoted as F(x), where X is the random variable and x is a value that X can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a continuous random variable X that follows a uniform distribution on the interval [0,1]. The CDF of X is:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(x) = 0, if x < 0\n",
    "F(x) = x, if 0 ≤ x < 1\n",
    "F(x) = 1, if x ≥ 1\n",
    "\n",
    "This CDF describes the cumulative probability of X taking on a value less than or equal to x. For example, the probability that X is less than or equal to 0.5 can be calculated by evaluating the CDF at x=0.5:\n",
    "\n",
    "F(0.5) = 0.5\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives a probability of 0.5, which represents the proportion of the total probability mass of X that falls below 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used because it provides a complete description of the probability distribution of a random variable, including both discrete and continuous distributions. It can be used to calculate probabilities for any interval of values, not just specific values like the PMF or PDF. Additionally, the CDF is a cumulative measure of probability, which can be useful in certain applications where we are interested in the probability of a certain outcome occurring after a certain number of trials or events.\n",

    "In summary, the CDF is a function that describes the cumulative probability of a random variable taking on a value less than or equal to a certain value. It is a useful tool for describing and analyzing probability distributions, and provides a complete description of the distribution that can be used to calculate probabilities for any interval of values."

    "<p>The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) relies on the following assumptions:</p>\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Independence: The samples or observations are independent of each other.</li>\n",
    "<li>Sample size: The sample size is sufficiently large. While there is no hard and fast rule for the minimum sample size, a commonly used rule of thumb is that the sample size should be at least 30.</li>\n",
    "<li>Identically distributed: The samples or observations are drawn from the same population, and therefore have the same mean and standard deviation.</li>\n",
    "<li>Finite variance: The population from which the samples are drawn must have a finite variance.</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>If these assumptions are met, then the sample means will converge to a normal distribution, regardless of the underlying distribution of the population. It is important to note that violating these assumptions can lead to inaccurate conclusions and the CLT may not hold.</p>\n",
